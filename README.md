### Code Examples :page_with_curl:

Here are some sample code examples demonstrating the usage of this project (might not same code as in project):

```python
# Example 1: Load and preprocess the data
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
# Perform preprocessing steps...

# Example 2: Train the customer segmentation model
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5)
kmeans.fit(data)

# Example 3: Visualize the segmentation results
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.scatter(data['Feature1'], data['Feature2'], c=kmeans.labels_)
plt.xlabel('Feature 1')
plt.ylabel('Feature 2')
plt.title('Customer Segmentation')
plt.show()
```
